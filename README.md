#Dog Breed Analyzer

Overview
Welcome to the Dog Breed Analyzer! This project provides a tool to identify dog breeds from images. Whether you're a dog enthusiast, a pet owner, or just curious, this application aims to accurately predict the breed of a dog based on an uploaded image.

Features
Image Upload: Easily upload dog images for analysis.

Breed Prediction: Utilizes a trained model to predict the most likely dog breed.

User-Friendly Interface: A simple and intuitive interface for seamless interaction.

How It Works
The Dog Breed Analyzer uses a machine learning model trained on a vast dataset of dog images to recognize and classify different breeds. When you upload an image, the model processes the visual data and outputs its prediction for the dog's breed.

Installation and Setup
To get a local copy of this project up and running, follow these simple steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Zerodistraction-max/Dog-bread-analyser.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd Dog-bread-analyser

Install dependencies:
(Please replace [dependency-manager] with pip, conda, or similar, and list specific requirements if known, e.g., pip install tensorflow scikit-learn)

# Example:
# pip install -r requirements.txt

If there isn't a requirements.txt file, you might need to install common libraries for machine learning, such as:

tensorflow or pytorch

scikit-learn

Pillow (for image processing)

flask or django (if it's a web application)

Usage
Once you have set up the project locally:

Run the application:
(Specify the command to start the application, e.g., for a Python web app:)

# Example:
# python app.py

Open in your browser:
Access the application through your web browser, typically at http://localhost:5000 (or another port if specified).

Upload an image:
Use the provided interface to upload an image of a dog.

View results:
The application will display the predicted dog breed.
