# üê∂ Dog Breed Analyzer

Welcome to the **Dog Breed Analyzer** ‚Äì your intelligent companion for identifying dog breeds from images! Whether you're a pet owner, dog lover, or just curious, this tool helps you recognize breeds with just one click.

## üöÄ Features

- üì∏ **Image Upload**  
  Upload any dog image using a simple and intuitive interface.

- üß† **Breed Prediction**  
  Harnesses the power of machine learning to predict the most likely breed from the image.

- üíª **User-Friendly Interface**  
  Clean and interactive design built for ease of use.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

The Dog Breed Analyzer is powered by a **transfer learning model** trained on a vast dataset of dog images. When you upload an image:
1. The model processes the image.
2. Extracts features using a CNN backbone.
3. Returns the most probable dog breed.

Explore the model and training steps in the [`dog-vision.ipynb`](dog-vision.ipynb) notebook.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

Get the project running locally with these steps:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the repository

```bash

git clone https://github.com/Zerodistraction-max/Dog-bread-analyser.git
cd Dog-bread-analyser

```

Install dependencies:
(Please replace [dependency-manager] with pip, conda, or similar, and list specific requirements if known, e.g., pip install tensorflow scikit-learn)


# Example:
# pip install -r requirements.txt

If there isn't a requirements.txt file, you might need to install common libraries for deep learning, such as:

tensorflow or pytorch

scikit-learn

Pillow (for image processing)

flask or django (if it's a web application)

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage
Once you have set up the project locally:

Run the application:
(Specify the command to start the application, e.g., for a Python web app:)

# Example:
# python app.py

Open in your browser:
Access the application through your web browser, typically at http://localhost:5000 (or another port if specified).

Upload an image:
Use the provided interface to upload an image of a dog.

View results:
The application will display the predicted dog breed.
