## 📂 Dataset Source

This project is based on the **Dog Breed Identification** competition hosted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification).

### 🐶 Challenge Overview

The goal of the competition is to develop an algorithm that can **identify the breed of a dog** from a given image. With over 120 distinct dog breeds provided in the dataset, this task challenges machine learning models to effectively learn and generalize from a wide variety of dog appearances.

### 📸 Dataset Highlights

- 10,000+ training images
- 120 dog breed categories
- High-quality labeled images of individual dogs
- CSV file mapping image IDs to breed names

### 🧪 Objective

Build a machine learning model that:
- Accepts an input image of a dog
- Outputs the most probable dog breed
- Works with high accuracy and handles different angles, lighting, and dog poses
